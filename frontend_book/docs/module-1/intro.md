# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module introduces you to ROS 2 as the middleware that connects AI agents to humanoid robot control systems.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand what ROS 2 is and why it matters for Physical AI
- Grasp the middleware concept and robot architecture overview
- Know the high-level ROS 2 architecture
- Understand ROS 2 communication patterns including nodes, topics, and services
- Be able to bridge AI agents to ROS using Python
- Understand the concepts of robot description using URDF

## Prerequisites

This module is designed for AI and CS students with:
- Basic Python knowledge
- No prior robotics experience required

## Module Structure

This module consists of three chapters:

1. **Chapter 1 - ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Introduces the core concepts of ROS 2 and its importance for Physical AI
2. **Chapter 2 - ROS 2 Communication**: Explains the communication patterns in ROS 2 with humanoid control examples
3. **Chapter 3 - Python Agents & Robot Description**: Shows how to connect AI agents to ROS using Python and introduces URDF

## Learning Approach

Each chapter follows a consistent structure:
- Learning objectives at the beginning
- Main content with examples
- Summary of key points
- Review questions to test your understanding

Begin with Chapter 1 to start your journey into the robotic nervous system!
