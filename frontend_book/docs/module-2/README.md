# Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation for Humanoid Robots

This module covers digital twin simulation for humanoid robots using physics-accurate and visually rich environments.

## Chapters

1. **Physics-Based Simulation with Gazebo** - Role of digital twins in Physical AI, simulating gravity, collisions, and dynamics, integrating ROS 2 with Gazebo
2. **High-Fidelity Environments with Unity** - Visual realism and human-robot interaction, Unity as a complementary simulation layer, use cases for training and visualization
3. **Sensor Simulation** - Simulating LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs, sensor data flow into ROS 2, preparing data for perception systems

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn to:
- Create physics-accurate simulations of humanoid robots using Gazebo
- Develop visually rich environments using Unity for enhanced visualization
- Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, cameras, IMUs) in the digital twin environment
- Integrate simulation data with ROS 2 for realistic robot control and perception

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic Python programming knowledge
