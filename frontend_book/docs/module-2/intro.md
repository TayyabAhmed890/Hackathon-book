# Introduction to Digital Twin Simulation

This module introduces digital twin simulation for humanoid robots using physics-accurate and visually rich environments. You'll learn how to create realistic simulations that accurately model physical robot behavior before real-world deployment.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will explore:

- **Physics-based simulation** with Gazebo to model accurate robot dynamics
- **High-fidelity environments** using Unity for visual realism
- **Sensor simulation** techniques for LiDAR, cameras, and IMUs

These technologies form the foundation of modern robotics development, allowing you to test and validate AI agents in safe, controlled virtual environments before deploying them on real robots.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic Python programming knowledge

## Getting Started

Each chapter in this module builds on the previous one, starting with physics simulation fundamentals and progressing to advanced visualization and sensor modeling techniques.
