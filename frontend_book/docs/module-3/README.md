# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac AI for Humanoid Robots

This module covers advanced perception, navigation, and training for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac, building on the ROS 2 and simulation foundations from previous modules.

## Chapters

1. **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** - Photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, and training-ready environments
2. **Isaac ROS for Perception** - Hardware-accelerated visual SLAM, sensor pipeline integration, and real-time perception
3. **Navigation with Nav2** - Path planning fundamentals and navigation adapted for bipedal humanoids

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn to:
- Create photorealistic simulation environments using NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Implement hardware-accelerated perception using Isaac ROS packages
- Configure Nav2 for humanoid robots with bipedal locomotion constraints
- Integrate simulation, perception, and navigation systems for complete AI-driven robot behavior

## Prerequisites

- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals) and Module 2 (simulation concepts)
- Access to an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (RTX 3060 or better recommended)
- Basic Python and C++ programming knowledge
- Understanding of computer vision and SLAM concepts
