# Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac AI for Humanoid Robots

This module introduces advanced perception, navigation, and training for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac. You'll learn how to create AI-driven robotic systems using NVIDIA's hardware-accelerated robotics stack, building on the ROS 2 and simulation foundations from previous modules.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you will explore:

- **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**: Photorealistic simulation environments with synthetic data generation capabilities
- **Isaac ROS Perception**: Hardware-accelerated perception pipelines for real-time AI inference
- **Nav2 Navigation for Humanoids**: Path planning and navigation adapted for bipedal locomotion

These technologies form the AI brain of modern humanoid robots, enabling sophisticated perception and navigation capabilities that were previously impossible with CPU-only processing.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals) and Module 2 (simulation concepts)
- Access to an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (RTX 3060 or better recommended)
- Basic Python and C++ programming knowledge
- Understanding of computer vision and SLAM concepts

## Getting Started

Each chapter in this module builds on the previous one, starting with Isaac Sim fundamentals and progressing to advanced perception and navigation techniques specifically adapted for humanoid robots.
