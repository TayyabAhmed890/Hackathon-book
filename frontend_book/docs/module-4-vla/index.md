# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Overview

This module demonstrates how large language models, perception, and robotics converge to produce intelligent humanoid behavior. You'll learn to build systems that can understand natural language commands, plan complex tasks, and execute them autonomously in simulation.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement voice-to-action interfaces using OpenAI Whisper and ROS 2 actions
- Use large language models for cognitive planning and task decomposition
- Create autonomous humanoid systems that integrate vision, language, and action
- Design and test complete VLA pipelines in simulation environments
- Evaluate and optimize the performance of autonomous robotic systems

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three progressive chapters:

- [Chapter 1: Voice-to-Action Interfaces](./chapter-1-voice-to-action/index.md): Foundation for processing voice commands and triggering robotic actions
- [Chapter 2: Cognitive Planning with LLMs](./chapter-2-cognitive-planning/index.md): Using large language models for complex task planning
- [Chapter 3: Capstone - The Autonomous Humanoid](./chapter-3-capstone/index.md): Complete system integration and autonomous execution

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Completed Modules 1-3 of this course
- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts and architecture
- Familiarity with Python programming and object-oriented concepts
- Access to OpenAI API for Whisper and GPT services
- A working simulation environment (Gazebo, Isaac Sim, or similar)

## Assessment

Complete the [Module Assessment](./assessment.md) to evaluate your understanding of VLA systems.

## Tutorial
