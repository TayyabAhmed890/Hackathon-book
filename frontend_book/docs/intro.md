# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This educational module introduces ROS 2 as the middleware that connects AI agents to humanoid robot control systems.

## Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

In this module, you will learn:

- What ROS 2 is and why it matters for Physical AI
- The middleware concept and robot architecture overview
- ROS 2 communication patterns including nodes, topics, and services
- How to bridge AI agents to ROS using Python

## Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

In this module, you will learn:

- What digital twins are and why they matter for robotics
- Physics simulation concepts and Gazebo environment setup
- Unity environment integration for advanced simulation
- Sensor simulation and perception system integration

## Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

In this module, you will learn:

- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for advanced robotics simulation
- Isaac ROS perception and sensor processing
- Navigation with Navigation2 (Nav2) framework
- AI integration for robot intelligence and decision making

## Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

In this module, you will learn:

- Voice-to-action interfaces using OpenAI Whisper
- Cognitive planning with large language models (LLMs)
- End-to-end autonomous humanoid systems
- Integration of vision, language, and action systems

This course is designed for AI and CS students with basic Python knowledge and no prior robotics experience.
