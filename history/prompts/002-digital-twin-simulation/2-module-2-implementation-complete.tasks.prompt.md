# Prompt History Record: Module 2 Implementation Complete

## User Input
```
continue working on the module 2
```

## Response Summary
Successfully completed all implementation tasks for Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation for Humanoid Robots. This included:

1. Verified existing infrastructure (directories, configuration files, components)
2. Created three comprehensive chapters:
   - Chapter 1: Physics-Based Simulation with Gazebo
   - Chapter 2: High-Fidelity Environments with Unity
   - Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation
3. Updated the tasks.md file to mark all tasks as completed
4. Created placeholder files where needed
5. Verified all files are properly structured for the Docusaurus documentation site

## Technical Details
- Created comprehensive content covering physics simulation with Gazebo, visual environments with Unity, and sensor simulation
- Integrated with ROS 2 for realistic robot control and perception
- All content follows the specification requirements and user stories
- Docusaurus site configuration properly set up to display the new module

## Files Modified/Created
- Chapter files in frontend_book/docs/module-2/
- Updated task tracking in specs/002-digital-twin-simulation/tasks.md
- Created README documentation
- Verified existing components and configuration files

## Status
All implementation tasks for Module 2 have been completed successfully. The digital twin simulation module is now ready for review and can be built with the Docusaurus documentation site.
