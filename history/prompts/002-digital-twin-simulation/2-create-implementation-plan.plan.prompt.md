# Create Implementation Plan

## PROMPT_TEXT

Set up Module 2 in Docusaurus and add three chapters, with all content written in Markdown (.md) files. Explain Gazebo physics, Unity environments, and sensor simulation to model humanoid digital twins before real-world deployment.

## RESPONSE_TEXT

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Digital Twin Simulation feature, including:
- Technical context with language/dependencies information
- Constitution compliance verification
- Project structure for documentation and simulation components
- Research document resolving all clarifications
- Data model for digital twin entities
- Quickstart guide for setup
- API contract for simulation management

## OUTCOME

Successfully completed Phase 0 (Research) and Phase 1 (Design) of the planning process. Created all required artifacts: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and contracts/simulation-api.yaml. The plan is ready for task generation and implementation.
