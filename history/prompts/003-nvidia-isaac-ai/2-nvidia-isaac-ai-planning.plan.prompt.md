# Prompt History Record: NVIDIA Isaac AI Planning Complete

## User Input
```
Create Module 3 in Docusaurus with three chapters, writing all content in Markdown (.md) files. Cover NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS perception, and Nav2 navigation to build the AI brain of a humanoid robot
```

## Response Summary
Successfully completed the planning phase for Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac AI for Humanoid Robots. This included:

1. Comprehensive implementation plan with technical context and constitution check
2. Detailed research on NVIDIA Isaac technologies and ecosystem
3. Complete data model with entities, relationships, and data flows
4. API contracts for Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS perception, and Nav2 navigation
5. Quickstart guide with detailed setup instructions
6. Complete task breakdown for implementation

## Technical Details
- Created detailed technical context with NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2 requirements
- Researched NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem including simulation, perception, and navigation components
- Defined comprehensive data model with Isaac Simulation Environment, Perception Nodes, SLAM System, and Navigation Planner entities
- Created three API contracts covering simulation, perception, and navigation systems
- Developed complete task breakdown with 30 tasks across 6 phases

## Files Created/Updated
- Implementation plan (plan.md)
- Research notes (research.md)
- Data model (data-model.md)
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md)
- API contracts for Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2
- Task breakdown (tasks.md)

## Status
The planning phase is complete with all required artifacts created. The implementation can proceed with the detailed plan, research findings, data model, API contracts, and task breakdown. All constitutional requirements have been verified and the design aligns with project principles.
