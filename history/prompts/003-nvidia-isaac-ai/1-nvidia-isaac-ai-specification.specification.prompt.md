# Prompt History Record: NVIDIA Isaac AI Specification

## User Input
```
Module: 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Goal:
Introduce advanced perception, navigation, and training for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac.

Target Audience:
Students with prior knowledge of ROS 2 and simulation.

Module Scope:
AI-driven perception and navigation using photorealistic simulation and hardware-accelerated robotics stacks.

Structure (Docusaurus – 3 Chapters):

Chapter 1: NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Photorealistic simulation
- Synthetic data generation
- Training-ready environments

Chapter 2: Isaac ROS for Perception
- Hardware-accelerated visual SLAM
- Sensor pipeline integration
- Real-time perception concepts

Chapter 3: Navigation with Nav2
- Path planning fundamentals
- Navigation for bipedal humanoids
- Preparing robots for autonomous movement
```

## Response Summary
Successfully created the complete specification for Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac AI for Humanoid Robots. This included:

1. Comprehensive feature specification with three user stories covering Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS perception, and Nav2 navigation
2. Complete functional requirements and success criteria
3. Quality checklist validation (all items marked complete)
4. Supporting documents: plan, research, data model, and quickstart guides

## Technical Details
- Created user stories prioritized as P1 (Isaac Sim), P2 (Isaac ROS Perception), P3 (Nav2 Navigation)
- Defined 10 functional requirements covering simulation, perception, and navigation
- Established 6 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Created complete project structure with all required specification artifacts

## Files Created
- Main specification (spec.md)
- Quality checklist (checklists/requirements.md)
- Implementation plan template (plan.md)
- Research notes (research.md)
- Data model (data-model.md)
- Quickstart guide (quickstart.md)

## Status
The specification is complete and validated. All checklist items are marked as complete. The feature is ready for planning phase (/sp.plan).
